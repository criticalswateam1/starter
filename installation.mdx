Step 1. Run the install script:

<CodeGroup>

```bash
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DDOS-Guardian/DDoS-Guardian/main/setup_ddosguardian_service.sh | sudo bash
```

</CodeGroup>

Once downloaded check the status of the guardian service. If it is online you can proceed.

```bash
systemctl status guardian
```

Step 2. File Preparation:

```bash
mkdir /etc/nginx/conf.d/ddos-guardian-layer-7
cd /etc/nginx/conf.d
mv protection.lua /etc/nginx/conf.d/ddos-guardian-layer-7
```

### Configuratuion

1. Add your server's IP address to the whitelist.

```bash
local whitelist = {
  "127.0.0.1",
  "YOURSERVERIP",
}
```

2. Obtain your Cloudflare Turnstile Key from https://cloudflare.com

- Login, navigate to Dashboard > Turnstile, create a new Turnstile configuration, and retrieve the Site Key.
  You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

3. Modify your `protection.lua` configuration with the turnstile key.

## Packages

Run the following command below to install the required packages for NGINX to function with the anti-ddos sytem.

```
sudo apt-get install libnginx-mod-http-lua
```

## Editing NGINX Configuration

We will need to edit the NGINX ( Webserver ) configuration.

1. Change Directories

```bash
cd /etc/nginx
```

2. Navigate to the folder `sites-available`.
   If using pterodactyl panel edit the `pterodactyl.conf` file.
   `nano pterodactyl.conf`

Add the following at the top of the file.

```
lua_shared_dict ddos_guardian_limit_dict 10m;
```

Add the following into the location block.

```
access_by_lua_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/ddos-guardian-layer-7/protection.lua;

```

If you are not using pterodactyl edit the `default file`
`nano default`
Add the following at the top of the file.

```
lua_shared_dict ddos_guardian_limit_dict 10m;
```

Add the following into the location block.

```
access_by_lua_file /etc/nginx/conf.d/ddos-guardian-layer-7/protection.lua;
```

<Tip>

To leave nano and save any modifications, use CONTROL + Q, then press Y and Enter.

## Deployment

Run the following command to check that your NGINX Configuration file is correct.

```bash
nginx -t
```

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/nginxtest.png" style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} />
</Frame>

Simply run the following command below and visit your domain and the anti-ddos should be setup.

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```
